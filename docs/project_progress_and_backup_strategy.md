# Lumina AI Project: Progress and Backup Strategy Documentation

## Project Status as of April 25, 2025

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress on the Lumina AI project and details the robust backup and version control strategy implemented to prevent code loss.

## 1. Project Structure

We have established a well-organized project structure for Lumina AI:

└── logs/                 # Progress logs
    └── daily/            # Daily progress logs
```

## 2. Version Control Strategy

We have implemented a robust version control strategy using Git with the following components:

### 2.1 Local Repository

- Initialized Git repository in `/home/ubuntu/lumina-ai`
- Configured with appropriate `.gitignore` file to exclude build artifacts, IDE files, and sensitive information
- Set up Git user configuration for consistent commit authorship

### 2.2 Commit Strategy

- Frequent commits with descriptive messages following conventional commits format
- Automatic backup commits triggered by the backup system
- Code snapshots captured in daily progress logs

### 2.3 Branching Strategy

- `main` branch for stable code
- `develop` branch for active development
- Feature branches for specific features (e.g., `feature/provider-service`)
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes (e.g., `hotfix/memory-leak`)

## 3. Automated Backup Solution

We have implemented a comprehensive automated backup solution with the following components:

### 3.1 Backup Scripts

- `backup.sh`: Creates ZIP backups of the repository and pushes to remote repositories
- `verify_repo.sh`: Verifies the integrity of the repository and backups
- `init_backup_system.sh`: Initializes the backup system and sets up cron jobs

### 3.2 Backup Schedule

- Daily full backups at 1:00 AM
- Full repository verification at 2:00 AM
- Quick verification every 4 hours during working hours (8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, 8 PM)

### 3.3 Backup Storage

- Local ZIP backups stored in `/home/ubuntu/backups/lumina-ai`
- Naming convention: `lumina-ai-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`
- 7-day retention policy for local backups

### 3.4 Remote Repositories

- Primary: GitHub repository (configured as `origin`)
- Secondary: GitLab repository (to be configured as `backup`)

## 4. Documentation System

We have established a comprehensive documentation system with version-tracked templates:

### 4.1 Documentation Templates

- Component Specification Template: For documenting individual components
- API Specification Template: For documenting APIs
- Technical Design Template: For documenting technical designs
- Progress Report Template: For documenting implementation progress

### 4.2 Version Tracking

- All documentation includes version information and change history
- Documentation is stored in the Git repository and versioned alongside code
- Major documentation versions are tagged in Git

## 5. Task Tracking System

We have implemented a standardized task tracking system using GitHub Issues:

### 5.1 Issue Templates

- Bug Report Template: For reporting bugs and defects
- Feature Request Template: For requesting new features
- Task Template: For general development tasks
- Documentation Task Template: For documentation-related tasks
- Testing Task Template: For testing-related tasks

### 5.2 Labels and Milestones

- Standardized labels for categorizing issues by type and priority
- Milestones aligned with the implementation plan phases

### 5.3 Project Boards

- Kanban-style project board with To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done columns
- Automated movement of issues based on status

## 6. Progress Tracking System

We have implemented a daily progress tracking system:

### 6.1 Daily Progress Logs

- Comprehensive template for daily progress reporting
- Automated generation script (`generate_daily_log.sh`)
- Includes code snapshots, tasks completed, blockers, and plans

### 6.2 Code Metrics

- Automated collection of code metrics (lines added/removed, files changed)
- Test coverage tracking
- Backup verification status

## 7. Continuous Integration

We have set up a continuous integration system using GitHub Actions:

### 7.1 CI Workflow

- Triggered on push to main branches, pull requests, and daily schedule
- Builds the project and runs tests
- Performs code quality checks
- Generates test coverage reports
- Verifies repository integrity
- Automatically generates daily progress logs

### 7.2 Artifacts

- Build artifacts are archived for each CI run
- Test coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov

## 8. Next Steps

The following steps are planned for the immediate future:

1. Complete the implementation of the Provider Service
2. Set up the Memory System
3. Develop the Tool Integration Framework
4. Implement the Planning System
5. Create the Multi-Agent Collaboration System

## 9. Recovery Procedures

In case of code loss or repository corruption, follow these recovery procedures:

### 9.1 From Local Repository

1. Use `git log` to identify the commit to recover
2. Use `git checkout <commit-hash>` to restore to that point
3. Create a new branch if needed with `git checkout -b recovery-branch`

### 9.2 From Remote Repository

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kimhons/lumina-ai.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd lumina-ai`
3. Check out the desired branch or commit

### 9.3 From ZIP Backup

1. Locate the appropriate backup in `/home/ubuntu/backups/lumina-ai`
2. Extract the ZIP file to a temporary location
3. Copy the needed files to the working directory

## 10. Conclusion

We have established a robust system for tracking code, documentation, and tasks for the Lumina AI project. This system includes multiple layers of protection against code loss, comprehensive documentation templates, standardized task tracking, and automated progress reporting. With these measures in place, we can confidently proceed with the implementation of Lumina AI without the risk of losing progress.
