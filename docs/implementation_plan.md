# Lumina AI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized next steps for continuing the development of the Lumina AI platform.

## Current Implementation Status

The Lumina AI platform is partially implemented with varying degrees of completion across components:

- **Provider Service**: 80% complete - Most controllers and models implemented
- **Other Microservices**: 50-70% complete - Framework exists but missing implementations
- **Frontend Components**: 60-75% complete - Well-structured but missing backend integration
- **Deployment Configuration**: 40-90% complete - Docker Compose most complete at 90%
- **Documentation**: 85-90% complete - Very well documented

## Key Implementation Gaps

1. **Service Implementations**: Critical service classes referenced by controllers (like ProviderService) are not fully implemented
2. **Repository Implementations**: Data access layer implementations are incomplete
3. **Integration Between Components**: Connections between microservices need implementation
4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Frontend components need to be connected to backend APIs
5. **Build Configuration**: Maven/Gradle build files need completion
6. **Deployment Scripts**: Some deployment scripts and configurations need implementation

## Implementation Approach

### Development Methodology
- **Iterative Development**
  - Implement features in small, testable increments
  - Regular integration to avoid divergence
  - Continuous testing throughout development
- **Component Prioritization**
  - Focus on Provider Service first as it's most complete
  - Implement critical path components before nice-to-have features
  - Ensure each component is functional before moving to the next

### Technical Considerations
- **Dependency Management**
  - Use consistent versions across all components
  - Minimize external dependencies
  - Document all third-party libraries
- **Code Quality**
  - Follow consistent coding standards
  - Implement code reviews
  - Use static analysis tools
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Identify performance bottlenecks early
  - Implement caching where appropriate
  - Optimize database queries

## Success Criteria
The project continuation will be considered successful when:
- All microservices are fully implemented and integrated
- The platform can be deployed using the provided configurations
- The frontend interfaces are connected to backend services
- Basic agentic capabilities are functional
- The system passes all tests (unit, integration, performance)
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date
