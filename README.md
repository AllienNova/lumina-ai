# Lumina AI

An enterprise-grade agentic AI platform with advanced capabilities.

## Overview

Lumina AI is a sophisticated AI platform that leverages multiple AI providers, advanced memory systems, multi-agent collaboration, and hierarchical planning to deliver superior autonomous capabilities. Unlike conventional AI systems that require constant human guidance, Lumina AI can independently understand objectives, plan execution steps, and carry tasks through to completion with minimal human intervention.

## Key Features

- **Provider-Agnostic Intelligence**: Leverages multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, etc.)
- **Advanced Memory System**: Sophisticated working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Dynamic team formation and negotiation between specialized agents
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Multi-level planning from high-level goals to concrete actions
- **Tool Integration Framework**: Extensive tool registry, execution, and development capabilities
- **Ethical Governance**: Comprehensive framework for responsible AI use

## Implementation Status

The Lumina AI platform is partially implemented with varying degrees of completion across components:

- **Provider Service**: 80% complete - Most controllers and models implemented
- **Other Microservices**: 50-70% complete - Framework exists but missing implementations
- **Frontend Components**: 60-75% complete - Well-structured but missing backend integration
- **Deployment Configuration**: 40-90% complete - Docker Compose most complete at 90%
- **Documentation**: 85-90% complete - Very well documented

## Next Steps

See our [Implementation Plan](docs/implementation_plan.md) for the detailed development roadmap.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the development environment and running the system will be added as implementation progresses.
